### About Sora [#]{.h-link}

On February 16, 2024, OpenAI unveiled its groundbreaking generative artificial intelligence model, "Sora." It is reported that Sora can generate a video lasting up to 60 seconds directly from textual prompts, featuring highly detailed backgrounds, intricate multi-angle shots, and emotionally rich characters.

This signifies OpenAI's expansion of its advanced AI technology into the realm of videos, following text and images. OpenAI also emphasizes that Sora serves as the foundation for a model capable of understanding and **simulating the real world**, marking a significant milestone towards achieving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

The emergence of OpenAI's video generation model was anticipated within the industry, with some noting that it arrived "faster than imagined." Others expressed excitement, stating that "we are truly witnessing the advent of a new industrial revolution."

As of today, **Sora has not been publicly released.** However, it is currently accessible to Red Team members for evaluating potential risks and critical areas. The OpenAI Sora team has expanded access to visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to gather feedback for improving the model to meet the needs of creative professionals. OpenAI is sharing early research progress, collaborating with individuals outside the organization, and seeking input to provide insights into upcoming AI features for the public.

SwiftSora enables effortless video creation by simply inputting text, making it a versatile tool for professionals and enthusiasts alike in video production and AI technology.

### Secure your API key [#]{.h-link}

SwiftSora now includes a straightforward server backend. To ensure the safety of OpenAI usage in certain regions, SwiftSora has introduced an additional layer of API proxy. This measure aims to prevent the inadvertent exposure or risk control by OpenAI of your API key. During deployment, you only need to set your SwiftSora domain as `OPENAI_API_PROXY_URL` in the `.env` file.

Additionally, besides the official OpenAI AI, we support any API service that aligns with OpenAI API standards. Simply set `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` to your API service provider's base URL during deployment
